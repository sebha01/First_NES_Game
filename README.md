# NESDevTemplate
NES Dev Template Tutorial repo
There will be folders that you will have to install additional software in. 
Details are provided in readme.txt files in the relevant locations

To avoid tracking local or temporary files, or source code/executables these
have been added to the .gitignore file, but to keep the appropriate folders
in the remote repo the readme.txt files have been added to tracked files using:

 > git add -f */readme.txt

 > git add -f */bin/readme.txt

If you download this repo as a template for your own, the tools folders will
not form part of your own repo. If you fork, you will only see the readme.txt
files in the tools folders.
